The transformations:
	translation:
		0.3 units in x-axis
		-0.25 units in y-axis
	scaling:
		0.5 by x-axis
		0.5 by y-axis
	rotation:
		30 degrees on x-axis
		45 degrees on y-axis
		60 degrees on z-axis

Return format should be in js:
	 const transformationMatrix = new Float32Array([
        
    	]);
